# Taking user input
name = input("Enter your name: ")  #takes input from the user
marks = int(input("Enter your marks: "))  # by default input takes the datatype as a string type, therefore if you want to use int or float add method before input() method
print(f"Hello {name}, you scored {marks} marks.") #f"{} function is used to make your code look good in a structural way
